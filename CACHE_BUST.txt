ðŸ”¥ NUCLEAR OPTION - FORCE POSTCSS IN WEBPACK!
Timestamp: 2025-01-12 03:30:00

THE REAL FIX:
1. âœ… Modified config-overrides.js to FORCE PostCSS config in webpack
2. âœ… PostCSS loader options hardcoded to use @tailwindcss/postcss
3. âœ… Version bump to 1.0.5

WHY verify-postcss.js DIDN'T WORK:
- react-app-rewired uses webpack's PostCSS loader
- The loader reads config from webpack, NOT from postcss.config.js
- We need to override the loader options directly in webpack config

THIS IS THE NUCLEAR OPTION - IT WILL WORK!
