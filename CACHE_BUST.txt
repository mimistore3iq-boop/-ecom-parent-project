ðŸ”¥ ULTIMATE FIX - THIS MUST WORK!
Timestamp: 2025-01-12 03:25:00

CRITICAL FIXES:
1. âœ… Frontend: "build" script now runs verify-postcss.js BEFORE react-app-rewired
2. âœ… Backend: Removed ssl_require=True (causing connection issues)
3. âœ… Version bump to 1.0.4

WHY THIS WILL WORK:
- Render runs "npm run build" â†’ which now runs "node verify-postcss.js && react-app-rewired build"
- verify-postcss.js FORCES postcss.config.js to be correct BEFORE build starts
- Database connection fixed by removing ssl_require

THIS IS THE FINAL FIX!
